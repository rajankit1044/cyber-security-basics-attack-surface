- Network ports  
- Cloud infrastructure  

---

### 5️⃣ OWASP Top 10
OWASP Top 10 lists the most critical web application security vulnerabilities, helping organizations prioritize security risks.

---

### 6️⃣ Data Flow & Attack Points

Attacks can occur at any stage of this flow.

---

### 7️⃣ Vulnerability vs Threat vs Risk
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness in the system  
- **Threat:** A potential attacker or danger
